 ## Important: Testing and Approval Process

To maintain quality and consistency, **all contributors must send me a private email with a download link to their improved or remixed versions** of the DC-10 3D cockpit pack **before publishing or sharing publicly**.

This allows me to:

- Test the modifications carefully  
- Provide feedback if needed  
- Approve the version for wider distribution  

Please email your submission to: sobkyayoub1@gmail.com

Thank you for helping keep this project high quality and fun for everyone!
