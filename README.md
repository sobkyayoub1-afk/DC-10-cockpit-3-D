## Important Note: 3D Cockpit Add-On Only

This project adds a **new 3D cockpit model and panel** to the Aerobridge DC-10 aircraft.

**It does NOT replace or override the existing 2D cockpit.**

The original 2D cockpit remains fully functional and intact.

The 3D cockpit is an additional feature intended to enhance the flying experience.

Please keep this in mind when making modifications or testing.
