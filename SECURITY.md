Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
And main security of the project you'll have to send me every version of your DC 10 that you may if you're modified version of this before you published for test for testing and if you do not do this, I will take down your repo cop so you'll need to send me all versions before you test it before you know you published to get something you'll need to send me all versions
